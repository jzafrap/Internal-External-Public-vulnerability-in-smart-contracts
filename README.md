# Internal-External-Public-vulnerability-in-smart-contracts
Example of exploiting vulnerability - bad use of internal external public in solidity smart contracts

PyggyBank is a basic smart contract allowing multiple deposits from any address, and a withdraw of all deposited funds in one transaction.
The programmer forgot to annotate the _withdraw function with "internal" modificator, so any malicious actor can hack the smart contract and stole the funds.
Steps to reproduce:

1. deploy VulnerablePiggyBank
2. do some deposits for one or more address. The VulnerablePiggyBank smart contract stores the funds internally, and get account of balance on every address.
 ...but before any of the participating addresses do withdraw, a malicious actor appears, doing the following steps:

3. deploy UsingVulnerablePiggyBank.sol smart contract, that uses the vulnerable contract.
4. do a transaction to call a function VulnerablePiggyBank._withdraw(), that should be "internal" and got deployed "public" by error:
5. By executing vulnerate() function, the malicious actor adquires all the funds in the vulnerable smart contract, draining the funds of all users.
